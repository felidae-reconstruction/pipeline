* tools for getting some statistics on rearrangements, also that points out
* where `interesting' rearrangements; integrate to hal tools

* the best assembly way to tell assembly errors from evolution to transmap
* genes -> transmap of genes the  way of alignment validation

* include the assembly of felis silvestris to the alignment
    - transfrom the alignments from Chromosmer to fasta files
    - add to alignment

*   add dog to alignment
